To make it easier to work with fuzzy search (a tool that lets you quickly search your files), I decided to not make the directory tree complicated by building my Sass folders with subdirectories within subdirectories. I did however separate the main Sass folders by easy to read section. Within those folders you will find tiny little modular files that are easier to read and support.
